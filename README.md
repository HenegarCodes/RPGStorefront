# RPGStorefront

Course assignment. Through 8 weeks built a storefront that allows you to buy, sell, and cancel order items. This ranges from weapons, armor, and health. It also has the functionality of descriptions, inventory, shopping cart, and an admin file.

THis was done in one of my first lasses for programming learning Java. It ook quite some time with a lot of errors. But this functions great and I ould love to add to it eventually. 

Uploading this way later as i forgot to upload it here back when i was creating it.
